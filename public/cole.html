However, there existed a few outliers, such how as out of every five groups, 	one of them were dysfunctional due to the group’s inability to reach a consensus on their course of action. A few 	of the children wanted to be the dominant figure in their group, which led to constant dispute among their peers, 	which resulted in a less-than-desirable outcome when the time came to test their creations. What this resulted in 	for me was an internal debate on whether or not I should direct the children to do a specific action in contrast 	to what they (or their perceived leader) was planning, or to just leave them be. I found that both had mixed results, 	as either the quarreling between the children would either end or intensify if I let them be, but simply directing them 	towards what they should do to solve a problem resulted in no mental growth on their part on how to problem-solve. </p><p>All of these negative aspects lead me to believe that such a program for guiding children to solve problems in 	STEM as a group is nearly impossible to not be dysfunctional and inefficient, and as such I do not support such assignments	in the future. The children may learn how to work in groups better, but such improvement can just as easily be achieved	through a day-to-day basis in the classroom. Ultimately the majority of the students will not remember what they learned	in their STEM projects as they were practically thrown into the task and therefore were almost reluctant to attempt to	comprehend all of the aspects of such a project. If the school district wishes to make such an attempt to teach the 	students about STEM, then several changes need to be made. One such change is that the project should be optional.	A student who has little to no interest in anything to do with STEM will more often than not be reluctant to take action 	in the group and therefore will ultimately be a liability to the group’s progress. Secondly, the project should be on a 	basis of small groups of two or three in contrast to the typical groups of six or seven that I experienced. Any more than	three will create dispute between certain cliques of the class. Lastly, the mentors watching them should be required to 	have previous experiences with young children (whether it be by a summer camp or what have you) in order to maximize the	efficiency of the projects and the ability of the students to understand what they are doing.   			</p>		</div>					<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>		<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>		 

<div class="ui raised very padded text container segment">  			<h1 class="ui header">Mentoring Blog</h1>  			<p>  				In the documentary Before the Flood, Leonardo DiCaprio (who was revealed to be the United Nations Ambassador for Peace) and other environmental enthusiasts attempt to persuade the audience to take action against climate change by revealing how much devastation has occurred to the planet due to the agendas of the wealthy in gas & oil industry. The main point of it, however, was to reveal how promises had been made to change the Earth for the better and almost no action has been taken to do so.

	Although the film was successful in informing me on how various institutions had made false promises to change the Earth, most of the statistics were not very surprising to me, so if anything the presentation of how climate change works was very repetitive and at times boring to me. The purpose behind the film itself is very good, but just like DiCaprio’s obvious inexperience throughout the film on how climate change works, the film is flawed in how it presents a possible solution for the problem. All that was said was that “gas and oil are bad!” and “solar and wind are great!” What the film failed to mention was the large amount of space that such wind turbines or panels take up, how the cost of such contraptions can at times result in a lack of profit altogether due to their reliance on such variables as wind patterns and levels of sunlight, or about all of the other sources of energy, such as nuclear energy, which has slowly been picking up steam throughout the years. The bottom line is no source of energy is perfect, but the film failed to show side-by-side comparisons of different sources of energy, so the message seemed a bit muddied at the end of the film.

		<h1>“FREEZE ME” Cryonics Documentary Analysis</h1>
		<p>
		

	The documentary which I watched was an episode from the TV series Naked Science, which focused on the prospect of cryongenically freezing a human body post-mortem hoping that one day the body may be reanimated with new advances in science and medicine. The main point of the documentary was to show how the freezing process worked and the problems that would have to be faced in order to freeze a whole human body for an extended period of time, as well as other aspects of such an operation such as the emotional experience of not having closure to a person’s life and whether or not such a process would give a dead person’s loved ones a feeling of hope or if it would give them a feeling of dissatisfaction. 

	Ultimately I found that the documentary tried to emphasize the point that “we will find a way to reanimate them eventually” like it was something that was guaranteed. I was reluctant to such a prospect as cryogenically freezing a human just to thaw them out decades later, but once the details of the procedure were revealed I was even more reluctant to the idea than ever. The show illustrated that a toxic preservative replaced the blood inside of the person’s body as well as most of the water inside of the body. Various pumps, wires and tubes were also mapped throughout the deceased carcass, including a hole that was drilled into the skull in order to add special preservatives to the brain. So according to such data, reanimation would require not only removing all of this special reservation equipment, not to mention various chemicals that would have to be replaced with blood and water, along with the other issue of ice crystals forming throughout the body over time during freezing, but also there would have to exist a process of reanimating a dead body in the first place. Such technology may be decades or maybe even centuries away, and such problems as ice crystal formation inside of the body during this waiting process pose a serious problem for the prospect of cryonics. Those who believe in cryonics also believe that the brain would remain intact with all of the person’s previous memories and personality, never mind the actual process of reanimation itself. Overall I feel that the documentary added even more doubt and reluctance to my opinion on cryonics, as so many variables exist that could prohibit a successful reanimation that I was turned off to the idea almost completely.

		<h1>“Contemporary Film Analysis: WALL-E” /h1>
		<p>
		

		In the film WALL-E, it is revealed that humanity has been away from Earth for 700 years due to them over-polluting the planet, surviving in space inside of a resort-like space cruiser known as the Axiom, giving the remaining humans shelter while the planet was “cleaned-up” by robots, also known as the WALL-E units. The twist of the film comes when a wheel-shaped AI known as AUTO was revealed to be programmed to keep the humans (who were now overweight and even unable to walk due to being heavily pampered by the ship’s sedentary lifestyle) in space forever, as the planet’s WALL-E units had all either been shut down due to lack of power or destroyed by the harsh conditions of the ruined planet (except for one, of course), and that it would be safer for the humans to remain on the ship than attempt to recolonize the now lifeless planet. The film analyzes the consequences of ignoring nature, as the humans were given little choice but to leave the planet due to their own pollution, while the film also includes a lesson about the downsides of having an ignorant, sedentary life, as the humans were shown to be so deformed that they hardly resembled present-day humans at all, with their muscle mass being nearly nonexistent and the great amount of fat separating bones in some places. 
</p>
	<p>
                The typical audience reaction, and mine personally, was the feeling of doom surrounding the now dormant remaining population of humans, as for centuries they had done nothing, and without the actions of WALL-E during his attempt to bring plant life back to the Axiom in order to redirect the ship back to Earth, they more than likely would have stayed in space for all of eternity due to their unprecedented amount of laziness and ignorance. The overarching message of the film was to embrace the nature of the Earth and all life forms on it, while not becoming too engrossed in technology. This is a point I largely agree with; in order to remain fully human, there must be a balance between technology and nature, as ignoring one or the other could either result in humans never becoming more than savages or the destruction of the entire planet. The message of the film was very touching and personally inspired me to become more knowledgeable on how to help the environment. This film could be used in the STEM project, as it exposes the consequences of becoming too immersed in technology, which emphasizes the importance of keeping our technology in check and doing all that we can to improve the environment and protecting all of the beautiful life on this planet, being the rare spectacle that it is.
