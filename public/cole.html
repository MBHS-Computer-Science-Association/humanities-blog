However, there existed a few outliers, such how as out of every five groups, 	one of them were dysfunctional due to the group’s inability to reach a consensus on their course of action. A few 	of the children wanted to be the dominant figure in their group, which led to constant dispute among their peers, 	which resulted in a less-than-desirable outcome when the time came to test their creations. What this resulted in 	for me was an internal debate on whether or not I should direct the children to do a specific action in contrast 	to what they (or their perceived leader) was planning, or to just leave them be. I found that both had mixed results, 	as either the quarreling between the children would either end or intensify if I let them be, but simply directing them 	towards what they should do to solve a problem resulted in no mental growth on their part on how to problem-solve. </p><p>All of these negative aspects lead me to believe that such a program for guiding children to solve problems in 	STEM as a group is nearly impossible to not be dysfunctional and inefficient, and as such I do not support such assignments	in the future. The children may learn how to work in groups better, but such improvement can just as easily be achieved	through a day-to-day basis in the classroom. Ultimately the majority of the students will not remember what they learned	in their STEM projects as they were practically thrown into the task and therefore were almost reluctant to attempt to	comprehend all of the aspects of such a project. If the school district wishes to make such an attempt to teach the 	students about STEM, then several changes need to be made. One such change is that the project should be optional.	A student who has little to no interest in anything to do with STEM will more often than not be reluctant to take action 	in the group and therefore will ultimately be a liability to the group’s progress. Secondly, the project should be on a 	basis of small groups of two or three in contrast to the typical groups of six or seven that I experienced. Any more than	three will create dispute between certain cliques of the class. Lastly, the mentors watching them should be required to 	have previous experiences with young children (whether it be by a summer camp or what have you) in order to maximize the	efficiency of the projects and the ability of the students to understand what they are doing.   			</p>		</div>					<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>		<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>		<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>		<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>		<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>			<a name="bottom"></a>	    			</div>			<div class="ui center aligned bottom attached segment">			<div class="positive ui animated button" onclick="location.href='#top'">    			<div class="visible content">To Top Post</div>    			<div class="hidden content">    				<i class="up arrow icon"></i>    			</div>    		</div>    	</div>	</body></html>
