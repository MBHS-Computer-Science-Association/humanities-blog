<strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>

While there were significant differences in the performances of different children, several trends were evident. Most of the groups were able to complete one (1) challenge, usually the task involving running the robot into a lever. Several groups were able to complete secondary tasks, such as the one that requires to bump the lever hanging off of the center. Despite this, there was not a significant difference in the number of tasks completed, with no more than two (2) completed by any groups observed. Given the relatively large number of tasks, many involving the necessary use of an arm with no group observed used, this seems to suggest that the children were largely unsuccessful at the task. We theorize three (3) main reasons for this shortcoming, including the inability to journal scientifically, the inability to construct complex machinery, and the inability to program effectively. The inability to journal scientifically seems to be directly caused by the dual cause of a student-teacher communication deficiency, and general lethargy on the student's part. This can be solved by more active communicative effort on the part of the teachers, through the stating of more clear goals for documentation purposes, as well as regular teacher checkups on student journals to ensure adequate progress is being completed. The inability of student group units to construct more complex machinery is most significantly caused by scant resource. There was a deficiency in certain Lego blocks to create even the base two (2) wheel drive unit, and certainly a lack of supplies to create the more complex superstructures of robotic arms. Despite this, students were able to construct the basic structures with instructions and often were able to construct innovative structures without guidance. Finally, perhaps the most prominent issue, was failure in the programming of the EV3 Robotic Kits. Our experiences show that children that age are able to program effectively with guidance, as seen in coding clubs that use the CS First program (Eddins Elementary Coding Club, 2016). However, they were unable to program the EV3 kits effectively because they did not have access to any guides, instead relying on the teaching of student volunteers who themselves did not know the EV3 software. More significantly the software was incredibly buggy, and often failed for no observable reason, with the only solution being the restarting of the programming process. This seems inherent to the Macintosh Operation System version of the EV3 software, not through While we suggest the continuation of the Science Technology Engineering and Math Alpha initiative, we suggest that these concerns are addressed. In conclusion, we suggest the implementation of
</p>
<p>- Greater communication between members of the teaching staff</p>
<p>- Greater communication between teachers and students</p>
<p>- Regular review of the work of students by teachers</p>
<p>- The availability of more construction parts to students</p>
<p>- Either the abandonment of the EV3 platform or the switching over to the less buggy Windows EV3 programming software</p>
<p>- Programming guides for students</p>
