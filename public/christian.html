<strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>

While there were significant differences in the performances of different children, several trends were evident. Most of the groups were able to complete one (1) challenge, usually the task involving running the robot into a lever. Several groups were able to complete secondary tasks, such as the one that requires to bump the lever hanging off of the center. Despite this, there was not a significant difference in the number of tasks completed, with no more than two (2) completed by any groups observed. Given the relatively large number of tasks, many involving the necessary use of an arm with no group observed used, this seems to suggest that the children were largely unsuccessful at the task. We theorize three (3) main reasons for this shortcoming, including the inability to journal scientifically, the inability to construct complex machinery, and the inability to program effectively. The inability to journal scientifically seems to be directly caused by the dual cause of a student-teacher communication deficiency, and general lethargy on the student's part. This can be solved by more active communicative effort on the part of the teachers, through the stating of more clear goals for documentation purposes, as well as regular teacher checkups on student journals to ensure adequate progress is being completed. The inability of student group units to construct more complex machinery is most significantly caused by scant resource. There was a deficiency in certain Lego blocks to create even the base two (2) wheel drive unit, and certainly a lack of supplies to create the more complex superstructures of robotic arms. Despite this, students were able to construct the basic structures with instructions and often were able to construct innovative structures without guidance. Finally, perhaps the most prominent issue, was failure in the programming of the EV3 Robotic Kits. Our experiences show that children that age are able to program effectively with guidance, as seen in coding clubs that use the CS First program (Eddins Elementary Coding Club, 2016). However, they were unable to program the EV3 kits effectively because they did not have access to any guides, instead relying on the teaching of student volunteers who themselves did not know the EV3 software. More significantly the software was incredibly buggy, and often failed for no observable reason, with the only solution being the restarting of the programming process. This seems inherent to the Macintosh Operation System version of the EV3 software, not through While we suggest the continuation of the Science Technology Engineering and Math Alpha initiative, we suggest that these concerns are addressed. In conclusion, we suggest the implementation of
</p>
<p>- Greater communication between members of the teaching staff</p>
<p>- Greater communication between teachers and students</p>
<p>- Regular review of the work of students by teachers</p>
<p>- The availability of more construction parts to students</p>
<p>- Either the abandonment of the EV3 platform or the switching over to the less buggy Windows EV3 programming software</p>
<p>- Programming guides for students</p>

<i>Before the Flood</i> featured Leonardo DiCaprio, as the United Nation Messenger for Peace, traveling around the world observing at the damages caused by climate change. This is meant to show views physical evidence for the destruction of the environment. First this counteracts any claims doubting its existence. Secondly, it provokes emotional responses. The sight of burning rain forests and dead coral reefs, causes viewers to feel astonished and disillusioned, and more likely to take <i>Before the Flood</i>'s call to action. <i>Before the Flood</i> also featured Leonardo DiCaprio talking to scientists making grim predictions about the future of the Earth following climate change. This is meant to provoke fear in the viewers about the possibility of a future where quality of life is damaged by climate change. <i>Before the Flood</i> put emphasis on Big Business effects on the environment and their role in lobbying the government. This gives the audience an enemy to rally against. Rallying for the end of Big Business' power in government action is probably the only action that <i>Before the Flood</i> has encouraged a significant portion of views to pursue. Overall, <i>Before the Flood</i> exposes those that did not understand already to the true damages of climate change and dire future predictions. However, it exposes to the majority of its audiences the role of Big Business' actions for the failure of government action to prevent climate change. Despite this, <i>Before the Flood</i> will probably cause the vast amount of popular discontentment that is necessary for a government change.

I am largely aware of the dangers of climate change, so those statistics did not leave an impact on me. <i>Before the Flood</i> informed me some of the extent of Big Business' involvement in government, however I largely knew of it, so this was not too surprising. I did find myself reacting rather emotionally to the images of environmental destruction. Overall I do not think the film was very influential on me. While I agree with the film's purpose-- to curtail climate change-- I disapprove of its methods. Despite generating more power than renewables in the United States (2014), the film did not mention Nuclear energy, even in passing. While it has its disadvantages, it is certainly preferable to the harmful fossil fuels. I find it irresponsible for <i>Before the Flood</i> not to mention either the current state of this energy or it as a possible replacement for fossil fuels. Similarly, <i>Before the Flood</i> did not mention GMOs or artificial meat as possibilities to lower the resource consumption by food production. <i>Before the Flood</i> largely failed to inform viewers about the full state of the environment and possibilities to advert climate change. These shortcomings have caused me to view the film is a largely negative light. The information in <i>Before the Flood</i> can be used in our STEM projects in two main ways. It can show how unregulated technological development has led to the destruction of the environment. However, it can also show how the current democratic institutions are not suited for dealing with rapid technological development.

<i>Cybertopia - Dreams of Silicon Valley</i>, was a documentary that primarily features interviewing Silicon Valley executives and visionaries about their visons for the future. For the most part these visionaries expressed their belief in how technology would improve human society and expressed their distaste for the current system. This included both the standard Wall Street corporation model and government itself. The most moderate of these beliefs were the desire to eliminate business regulation that limited Silicon Valley companies. Secondly, there was optimism about hierarchically flat and hacker cultured companies to break into and revolutionize Wall Street's businesses, an entity that was spoken only with distain. Several went as far as to declare traditional government as obsolete. They promised the idea of competitive government governments that competed among themselves for the residency of citizens. Better governments would grow stronger as they gained more citizens while weaker governments would grow weaker as they lost them-- essentially a concept of government similar to a business in a free enterprise system. Additionally, there was idolization of the hippie communes, where a community shared all property and production. Parallels between hippie culture and modern hacker culture were drawn, with special notice to Burning Man, a week long even where hackers go to live as a community and work together to create art. I, as I imagine much of the audience was, as skeptical of Silicon Valley's self-proclaimed social revolutionary power. I imagine much of the audience rejects the idea of the radical transformation and shrinking of government as well as communes. I find the idea of competitive governments as unrealistic, although I support the idea of communes. I do not wish, as many of these Silicon Valley visionaries do, for government to withdraw business regulations, as I fear a return to the horrors of the Industrial Revolution. Instead I hope for government expansion to include more business regulation as well as socialist policies such as universal healthcare. The audience responses for this, of course, very strongly on ideological lines. This could be useful to our project by showing how new social movements have arose from the technological revolution. Additionally, it can be used to describe one future that technology could bring us to.</p>
