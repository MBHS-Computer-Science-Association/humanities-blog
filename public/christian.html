	ABSTRACT: 

While there were significant differences in the performances of different children, several trends were evident. Most of the groups were able to complete one (1) challenge, usually the task involving running the robot into a lever. Several groups were able to complete secondary taks, such as the one that requires to bump the lever hanging off of the center. Despite this, there was not a significant difference in the number of tasks compeleted, with no more than two (2) completed by any groups observed. Given the relativly large number of tasks, many involving the necesary use of an arm with no group obserbed used, this seems to suggest that the children were largy unsucessful at the task. We theorize three (3) main reasons for this shortcoming, including the inability to journal scientificly, the inability to construct complex machinary, and the inability to program effectivly. The inability to journal scientificly seems to be directly caused by the dual cause of a student-teacher communication definciency, and general lethargy on the student's part. This can be solved by more active commincative effort on the part of the teachers, through the stating of more clear goals for documentation purposes, as well as regular teacher checkups on student journals to ensure adequete progress is being completed. The inability of student group units to construct more complex machinary is most significantly caused by scant resource. There were a deficiency in certain lego blocks to create even the base two (2) wheel drive unit, and cetainly a lack of supplies to create the more complex superstructures of robotic arms. Other than this students seemed, for the most part, students seemed able to construct structures with instructions and often were able to construct inovative structures without guidence. Finally, perhaps the most prominant issue, was failure in the programming of the EV3 Robotic Kits. Our experiences show that children that age are able to program effectivly with guidence, as seen in coding clubs that use the CS First program (Eddins Elementry Coding Club, 2016). However they were unable to program the EV3 kits effectivly because they did not have access to any guides, instead relying on the interminant attention of student volunteers who themselves did not know the EV3 software. More significantly the sotware was incredibly buggy, and often failed for no obserbable reason, with the only solution being the restarting of the programming process. This seems inherent to the Macintosh Operation System version of the EV3 software, not through While we suggest the continuation of the Science Technology Engineering and Math Alpha inititive, we suggest that these concerns are adressed. In conclusion we suggest the implmentation of
- Greater communication between memebers of the teaching staff
- Greater communication between teachers and students
- Checks on the work of students by teachers
- The availibility of more construction parts to students
- Either the abandonment of the EV3 platform or the switching over to the less buggy windows programming software
- programming guids for students
