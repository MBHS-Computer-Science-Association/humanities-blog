<strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>

While there were significant differences in the performances of different children, several trends were evident. Most of the groups were able to complete one (1) challenge, usually the task involving running the robot into a lever. Several groups were able to complete secondary tasks, such as the one that requires to bump the lever hanging off of the center. Despite this, there was not a significant difference in the number of tasks completed, with no more than two (2) completed by any groups observed. Given the relatively large number of tasks, many involving the necessary use of an arm with no group observed used, this seems to suggest that the children were largely unsuccessful at the task. We theorize three (3) main reasons for this shortcoming, including the inability to journal scientifically, the inability to construct complex machinery, and the inability to program effectively. The inability to journal scientifically seems to be directly caused by the dual cause of a student-teacher communication deficiency, and general lethargy on the student's part. This can be solved by more active communicative effort on the part of the teachers, through the stating of more clear goals for documentation purposes, as well as regular teacher checkups on student journals to ensure adequate progress is being completed. The inability of student group units to construct more complex machinery is most significantly caused by scant resource. There was a deficiency in certain Lego blocks to create even the base two (2) wheel drive unit, and certainly a lack of supplies to create the more complex superstructures of robotic arms. Despite this, students were able to construct the basic structures with instructions and often were able to construct innovative structures without guidance. Finally, perhaps the most prominent issue, was failure in the programming of the EV3 Robotic Kits. Our experiences show that children that age are able to program effectively with guidance, as seen in coding clubs that use the CS First program (Eddins Elementary Coding Club, 2016). However, they were unable to program the EV3 kits effectively because they did not have access to any guides, instead relying on the teaching of student volunteers who themselves did not know the EV3 software. More significantly the software was incredibly buggy, and often failed for no observable reason, with the only solution being the restarting of the programming process. This seems inherent to the Macintosh Operation System version of the EV3 software, not through While we suggest the continuation of the Science Technology Engineering and Math Alpha initiative, we suggest that these concerns are addressed. In conclusion, we suggest the implementation of
</p>
<p>- Greater communication between members of the teaching staff</p>
<p>- Greater communication between teachers and students</p>
<p>- Regular review of the work of students by teachers</p>
<p>- The availability of more construction parts to students</p>
<p>- Either the abandonment of the EV3 platform or the switching over to the less buggy Windows EV3 programming software</p>
<p>- Programming guides for students</p>

<i>Before the Flood</i> featured Leonardo DiCaprio, as the United Nation Messenger for Peace, traveling around the world observing at the damages caused by climate change. This is meant to show views physical evidence for the destruction of the environment. First this counteracts any claims doubting its existence. Secondly, it provokes emotional responses. The sight of burning rain forests and dead coral reefs, causes viewers to feel astonished and disillusioned, and more likely to take <i>Before the Flood</i>'s call to action. <i>Before the Flood</i> also featured Leonardo DiCaprio talking to scientists making grim predictions about the future of the Earth following climate change. This is meant to provoke fear in the viewers about the possibility of a future where quality of life is damaged by climate change. <i>Before the Flood</i> put emphasis on Big Business effects on the environment and their role in lobbying the government. This gives the audience an enemy to rally against. Rallying for the end of Big Business' power in government action is probably the only action that <i>Before the Flood</i> has encouraged a significant portion of views to pursue. Overall, <i>Before the Flood</i> exposes those that did not understand already to the true damages of climate change and dire future predictions. However, it exposes to the majority of its audiences the role of Big Business' actions for the failure of government action to prevent climate change. Despite this, <i>Before the Flood</i> will probably cause the vast amount of popular discontentment that is necessary for a government change.
</p>
<p>
I am largely aware of the dangers of climate change, so those statistics did not leave an impact on me. <i>Before the Flood</i> informed me some of the extent of Big Business' involvement in government, however I largely knew of it, so this was not too surprising. I did find myself reacting rather emotionally to the images of environmental destruction. Overall I do not think the film was very influential on me. While I agree with the film's purpose-- to curtail climate change-- I disapprove of its methods. Despite generating more power than renewables in the United States (2014), the film did not mention Nuclear energy, even in passing. While it has its disadvantages, it is certainly preferable to the harmful fossil fuels. I find it irresponsible for <i>Before the Flood</i> not to mention either the current state of this energy or it as a possible replacement for fossil fuels. Similarly, <i>Before the Flood</i> did not mention GMOs or artificial meat as possibilities to lower the resource consumption by food production. <i>Before the Flood</i> largely failed to inform viewers about the full state of the environment and possibilities to advert climate change. These shortcomings have caused me to view the film is a largely negative light. The information in <i>Before the Flood</i> can be used in our STEM projects in two main ways. It can show how unregulated technological development has led to the destruction of the environment. However, it can also show how the current democratic institutions are not suited for dealing with rapid technological development.

<i>Cybertopia - Dreams of Silicon Valley</i>, was a documentary that primarily features interviewing Silicon Valley executives and visionaries about their visons for the future. For the most part these visionaries expressed their belief in how technology would improve human society and expressed their distaste for the current system. This included both the standard Wall Street corporation model and government itself. The most moderate of these beliefs were the desire to eliminate business regulation that limited Silicon Valley companies. Secondly, there was optimism about hierarchically flat and hacker cultured companies to break into and revolutionize Wall Street's businesses, an entity that was spoken only with distain. Several went as far as to declare traditional government as obsolete. They promised the idea of competitive government governments that competed among themselves for the residency of citizens. Better governments would grow stronger as they gained more citizens while weaker governments would grow weaker as they lost them-- essentially a concept of government similar to a business in a free enterprise system. Additionally, there was idolization of the hippie communes, where a community shared all property and production. Parallels between hippie culture and modern hacker culture were drawn, with special notice to Burning Man, a week long even where hackers go to live as a community and work together to create art. I, as I imagine much of the audience was, as skeptical of Silicon Valley's self-proclaimed social revolutionary power. I imagine much of the audience rejects the idea of the radical transformation and shrinking of government as well as communes. I find the idea of competitive governments as unrealistic, although I support the idea of communes. I do not wish, as many of these Silicon Valley visionaries do, for government to withdraw business regulations, as I fear a return to the horrors of the Industrial Revolution. Instead I hope for government expansion to include more business regulation as well as socialist policies such as universal healthcare. The audience responses for this, of course, very strongly on ideological lines. This could be useful to our project by showing how new social movements have arose from the technological revolution. Additionally, it can be used to describe one future that technology could bring us to.</p>

<i>2001, A Space Odyssey</i> is a multipart story. It starts with the "Dawn of Man", where protohumans learn from an alien space device how to use tools. The first use of these tools by the enlightened tribe of protohumans is to use the tools to kill a protohuman from a rival tribe. This shows the audience how technology has been used for death and destruction, in the past. Following this, the movie focused on a scientist's investigation of a strange finding on the moon. This is used by the film makers to display their predictions for technological advancement. The technology showed is depicted as helpful and largely whimsical. This is meant to display the positive aspects of technology in the current day and near future. This section ends when the strange discovery turns out to be the same alien space device as the first part of the movie, which kills several scientists. The third part of the movie describes the secret mission of Dave and Frank to investigate the signals predated by the alien space device towards Jupiter. When their computer system HAL9000 malfunctions, Dave and Frank discuss disconnecting it from the space ship. HAL9000, fearing this, kills the hibernating crew members and Frank, before Dave shuts it down. This represents the danger that technology could represent to humanity in the future, especially concerning Artificial Intelligence. The final aspect of the movie involves Dave arrival at Jupiter and his contact with the creators of the alien device, which ends with him being reborn as a higher being. This represents to audiences the opportunity for humanity to use technology to improve themselves beyond any imagination. 
</p>
<p>
Overall the film showed audiences how technology endangered and could help humanity in the past present and future. The film left audiences both optimistic about future technology and cautious about unintended results of it. Looking back at the movie 50 years later, the message is still relevant. I, for the most part, agree with the movie's message. I am optimistic about how technology has, done and will help humanity, however I appreciate the dangers that oversight in its development can lead to. I recognize the horrors that technology led to, from the exploitation of workers in the Industrial Revolution, to the ever increase in the damage and casualties dealt in warfare. Overall, 2001, was much more rounded and less naively one sided as most movies that deal with technological advancement is. This movie, can be used to show how the public both fears and admire technological progress. The movie can be used to show the metaphorical fork in the road that our society is met with, and the magnitude of the direness of our choice.

<p>	A brief look at the education system’s treatment of science, technology, engineering, and math reveals that there is a gamut of excellence. There are the high achieving high schools like Palo Alto High School located across the street from Stanford, with extraordinary pass rates for AP Exams. There are the genuinely advanced high schools like Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology that has upwards of seven computer science classes ranging from artificial intelligence to parallel computing, which cover undergraduate computer science topics. However, these is the exception to the rule. While the endearingly known Paly and TJHSST are technically considered public schools, they sit on the highest echelon of a pre-collegiate education.
</p> <p>
	Educational funding is based on property taxes, meaning that less affluent locales aren’t graced with the same endless supply of money as more affluent neighborhoods. Unfortunately with a technology education, capital is necessary in order to purchase school district technology. In addition, money is required to pay for highly skilled professionals to teach a variety of classes. </p> <p>
	The situation is that not enough schools are even fortunate enough to have a STEM program at their school. The youth’s perception of technology is marred by the fact that despite technology’s ubiquitous nature, they sometimes feel ostracized in regards to a technological education because of the few individuals who excel at topics such as computer science. In specific, because computer science is more accessible than something like medicine, there is a minority of youth that have become extremely proficient in technology while leaving the majority more or less ignorant of the finer details. The solution to this problem is to make technological education even more accessible by an effort to creating openings in public education through integration.

</p>
<p>
	Due to the fact that the overall spectrum of learning in the department of STEM is extremely unorganized and overly specialized to a specific group of students, the best way to teach STEM is to integrate STEM subjects to other core-based classes. Such an act would not only enable the student to learn more subjects at once without requiring them to take a separate source but would also put into perspective the usefulness of certain subjects later in their lives; For example, one of the most common complaints from students of advanced math classes is how they will use such rigorous knowledge in the real world, and such a thing as integration of STEM would be able to connect it to separate subjects, such as how calculus would pertain to biology. Another event that must occur in order to improve the state of STEM in our school systems is to make the classes themselves tie into real-world problem solving more effectively. One institution that already utilizes such a system is Palo Alto High School, which utilized the class Advanced Problem Solving with Mathematics, which is specifically designed to place the usefulness of the class into perspective for the student, making them feel less isolated in the sea of numbers and equations that a traditional math class provides. Such an effective connection could be utilized nationwide instead of restricted to an elite school in Silicon Valley in order to both minimize stress put onto the student and also more efficiently teach them how to incorporate their newly obtained knowledge later in their lives. A beneficial result to all of this would also be the fact that the student has the chance to become interested in other STEM-related subjects while taking core classes, which could serve as an assistant to the student when they are searching for what they should major in when they go to college, which reduces stress and maximized potential experience in the field. 
</p>
<p>
	Several changes are required to integrate STEM concepts into the core curriculum. First, STEM courses must integrate between themselves. This is already done to an extent. For example, science classes regularly require math concepts. This can be taken further though. For instance, mathematical courses can use real science problems as a basis to teach math. Similarly, engineering can use computer modules to test their engineering design. This is the path already taken in many prestigious colleges. For instance, students trying to learn Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at Austin take highly integrated Artificial Intelligence and Neurology courses. This allows these students, who will most likely not go into the medical field, to understand Artificial Intelligence modules such as Artificial Neural Networks, a module based on the operation of animal brains. This also occurs at advanced high schools, whether private or exclusive public ones (such as Thomas Jefferson High School of Math and Technology) often use this kind of integration. This innovation, however, is largely lacking from more traditional public schools, even in affluent neighbors.. </p>
