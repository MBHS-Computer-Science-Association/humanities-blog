  				The STEM Mentoring project provided the kids with a unique experience and entry into the STEM world and its possibilities, as well as gave us valuable experience as leaders and instructors. However, there are several shortcomings about the program that can be solved in the future.
  			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of sharing such a prominent subject to the smart minds of future generations will ultimately teach problem solving, and enhance their logical thinking skills as they work to find solutions to problems through programming and robotics. All of my complaints stem from the lack of management from the administration that ultimately organized our meetings, and provided the infrastructure with which to teach. The software that we used to program the robots had issues which even us 4th year computer science students could not solve, rendering many teams inept and frustrated for extended periods of time. It would have also been extremely helpful to have a static curriculum for the mentors to follow, to ensure that all the groups got the same information and type instruction; mentors were frequently “winging“ their instruction with little to no guide. I felt that many groups got unequal instruction and even realized how disorganized some of the scheduling was. Next year, I hope to organize a course of instruction for all mentors to follow, and test all of the software and robots to ensure that they do indeed function as intended so as to not disrupt the steady instruction.
