  				The STEM Mentoring project provided the kids with a unique experience and entry into the STEM world and its possibilities, as well as gave us valuable experience as leaders and instructors. However, there are several shortcomings about the program that can be solved in the future.
  			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of sharing such a prominent subject to the smart minds of future generations will ultimately teach problem solving, and enhance their logical thinking skills as they work to find solutions to problems through programming and robotics. All of my complaints stem from the lack of management from the administration that ultimately organized our meetings, and provided the infrastructure with which to teach. The software that we used to program the robots had issues which even us 4th year computer science students could not solve, rendering many teams inept and frustrated for extended periods of time. It would have also been extremely helpful to have a static curriculum for the mentors to follow, to ensure that all the groups got the same information and type instruction; mentors were frequently “winging“ their instruction with little to no guide. I felt that many groups got unequal instruction and even realized how disorganized some of the scheduling was. Next year, I hope to organize a course of instruction for all mentors to follow, and test all of the software and robots to ensure that they do indeed function as intended so as to not disrupt the steady instruction.

				<m>Before the Flood</m> assumes an aggressive stance on the protection of environmental qualities, and utilizes the emotional character of its viewers to persuade them to consider their environmental impact. DiCaprio’s central role is something which many people can connect through, while questionable b-roll material and frightening rhetoric give it substance.
  			</p>

				The film had very little impact on me personally, because I am aware of the effects of large pollution on the environment. I was frightened by the depiction of environmental changes, however, the film offered very few alternatives to fossil fuel. The film only suggests we switch completely to “renewable” resources which produce electricity. The problem with this approach is that it focuses too much on the “big picture”, and that it doesn’t give its audience enough small steps to begin reducing their carbon footprint. If this is the beginning of an energy revolution as the film suggests, certainly we must start somewhere, and the film makes little effort to give people paths with which to lead less polluting lives. The thing that struck me the greatest though was the complete disregard of nuclear energy. <m>Before the Flood</m> was only concerned with converting directly from fossil fuels to renewable sources and electricity. Nuclear power has long been a stepping stone away from fossil fuels, and has not been used to its full extent around the world yet. Nuclear power is relatively clean, except for mining the resources and the radioactive waste it produces, because it has almost 400 times less of a carbon footprint then producing coal energy does. It is negligent of the producers to completely ignore such a valuable and clean form of energy for this film. On a side note, the b-roll footage frequently included evaporation towers as an example of pollution, which emit nothing but water vapor, and troubled animals and wildlife with no explanation of their condition with respect to climate change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One aspect of the film which I did appreciate was its depiction of large corporations in a largely negative light. The Big Business aspect of climate change is certainly a barrier to change in the energy world, and <m>Before the Flood</m> does a respectable job at conveying it. However, the shortcomings of this film keep me from viewing it positively, as I was already aware of all the ideas it presented, and found many of them questionable. The information in it can be used in our STEM projects to understand the environmental impact of technological progress on the environment, and is something more than just to consider, but to act upon. The film also highlights a major problem with many of the world’s democratic societies, which is the inability to facilitate change quickly, especially in dire times.
