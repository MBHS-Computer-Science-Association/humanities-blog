			<h3 class="ui header">Blade Runner (In review)</h3>
			<h4 class="ui header">2/13/17</h4>
			<p>
				<em>Blade Runner</em> takes a science fiction perspective on future technology. The primary STEM element in the film is the problem of specially engineered replicants, which are visually indistinguishable from humans but are capable of greater physical tasks. In the film, the main character is more or less on a mission to eliminate replicants that are on earth wrongfully, and as they develop unintended emotions are a crucial threat to humans. 
			</p>
				The film presents the theme of synthetic world domination by showing how such advanced technology could become a threat to humans as the artificial realm becomes indistinguishable from the natural. The perspective of the film on this type of synthetic replication is obviously negative, as the replicants represent a detrimental threat to unknowing citizens of Los Angeles.
			<p>
				The entire presence of the replicants represents a troubling existential crisis for both humans and the replicants. More generally, if technology reaches a point where it is possible to create synthetic entities that are better than humans at certain tasks, what is the point of humans ourselves living the same lives as we do now? Why not just create an artificial being to take care of all our dirty work? There must be a distinction between using artificial beings for physical tasks that unlock new human abilities, and simple convenience operation that are not critical to our existence, such as in <em>Blade Runner</em> where the replicants are used exclusively for menial physical tasks on Mars. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The future of STEM is addressed by the frightfulness of its unknowns in <em>Blade Runner</em>, and it raises the question of whether technology should be used only in physical applications for safety reasons, or whether they could develop an emotional domain that could actually help the human condition in other ways.  Upon its release, many critics disliked the film for its complexity, however, as time goes on more people are beginning to realize how a situation like the one presented in the film is becoming more relevant to the state of STEM research. The subliminal argument in <em>Blade Runner</em> is extremely relevant to the current state of STEM research, especially with its message about the confusion of the true purpose of STEM with regards to the human condition. As we begin to theorize how STEM research can be implemented into all classroom instruction, It is critical now that we make a decision about how we want it impact the kids of the future.

			<h3 class="ui header">The End of Ownership (In Review)</h3>
			<h4 class="ui header">2/3/17</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The End of Ownership</em> is a documentary film that breaks down our modern economy from the view of technological innovation. The film’s purpose is to explain how our dependency on electronic products feeds the stagnation of our economy, and thus innovation, and greatly concerns the future of STEM development.
				</p>
				<p>
					The film’s primary dogma is that from the very beginning of modern consumerism, consumer electronic devices have been designed to fail for the benefit of business. It uses the now longest lasting lightbulb as evidence for this. Residing in Livermore, California, and crafted by Thomas Edison, the lightbulb has burned for 116 years. Upon meeting with the Philips electronics company, they said that for his bulbs to be a reasonable business concept, they could not last forever; so, they designed them to operate for 1000 hours. This presents an obvious problem in our capitalist economy; one that becomes more evident as electronic waste constitutes growing mountains of non-biodegradable, chemically-laced poison that encroach ever so slowly on the environment and wildlife in the world’s major tech producing centers, such as Shen Zhen, China. The fact is that with privately-owned property, the production of electronic products from essentials like lightbulbs to luxury items like mobile phones that truly last a lifetime would cripple the industry. It may be a hard conclusion to make, but if our electronics were designed to outlast their useful lifespan, which can be done, the need to buy anything new, would be essentially gone. A situation like that might seem great for the consumer, but the lack of revenue from repeated customers would completely deprecate the monetary funding and emotional urge for research and development of new products in most categories of the tech industry, essentially putting the entire world at a technological stalemate. Companies would shut down and governments would be forced to intervene to support all aspects of consumer life, with the only progress possibly being in the medical industry, and that sounds like communism.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is where the title of <em>The End of Ownership</em> begins to make sense. The documentary revolves around Thomas Rau and his revolutionary proposal to Philips. His philosophy turns our idea of how the worldwide economy works on its head by putting companies into a position where they will benefit by creating long-lasting products, as opposed to the current system which incentivizes planned obsolescence. The idea is that companies will become invested in the end user by becoming accountable for picking up the tab for electricity and repair costs, and the end user pays a subscription fee to essentially “rent” their products. This creates an environment where companies are forced to create products that are reliable and efficient for their own sake, resulting in a happier end user and even steadier income for the companies. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The economic strategy presented in <em>The End of Ownership</em> has applications in every aspect of the current consumer-economy, most notably the private-housing sector. This strategy would allow corporations to produce more efficient appliances and electronics that are more reliable and ultimately last much longer, vastly reducing the environmental footprint of the tech industry. I believe that this concept is one of the best answers to the growingly corporate-dominated economy in countries like the US, and, if adopted at least in some part, opens the door to even more innovation and growth in the technology industry. This applies directly to our STEM project as it is concerned with the viability of continuing our current path of consumerism in developed countries all around the world. The future of the tech industry largely rests on the ability of the economies of the free world to support its businesses. As the predatory corporate landscape becomes more and more parasitic to the common consumer, we get closer and closer to a total collapse of the middle class, and that isn’t good for business. 
				</p>
				<p>
					So, to investigate the future of STEM instruction, you must first understand the economic circumstances with which it must survive. The future of the worldwide tech industry is in danger due to the economic imbalance outlined above, and the philosophies outlined by Thomas Rau offer a solution for the future. STEM instruction for the next few generations will obviously become more technology-focused as electronic advancements saturate more and more of our daily lives, but I am doubtful of the feasibility of continued consumerism of the type you see in all the world’s developed countries. In my opinion, <em>The End of Ownership</em> is the first documentary that acknowledges the major problem that goes unseen in today’s world, and that is the full-fledged dependence on the repeated consumer. I am largely in favor of its solution as well, as it offers a very well thought out solution to the problem. The only flaw I can foresee are the shortcomings that may result if big government has a say, which could be detrimental to Rau’s philosophy and the proposed pseudo-consumerism of free people. I see this documentary as a milestone in the continued process of innovation. We are at a point where we must reconsider the ways our economy works for- and against the consumers, and present possible ways to rebalance its current state.
				</p>
				<p>
					 The future of STEM instruction in schools can only be bright if we allow it to be, and that means creating a new economic climate such as the one proposed by Rau, to drastically reduce the scale of production of electronic goods, and use environmentally friendly recycling techniques with old products. With this in mind, if we continue our current path, environmental damage and the depression of the consumer may lead to the end of fast-paced technological development, and severely hurt the ability of STEM instruction to have a meaningful impact on the kids of the future.

			<h3 class="ui header">Before the Flood</h3>
			<h4 class="ui header">1/27/17</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Before the Flood</em> assumes an aggressive stance on the protection of environmental qualities, and utilizes the emotional character of its viewers to persuade them to consider their environmental impact. DiCaprio’s central role is something which many people can connect through, while questionable b-roll material and frightening rhetoric give it substance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The film had very little impact on me personally, because I am aware of the effects of large pollution on the environment. I was frightened by the depiction of environmental changes, however, the film offered very few alternatives to fossil fuel. The film only suggests we switch completely to “renewable” resources which produce electricity. The problem with this approach is that it focuses too much on the “big picture”, and that it doesn’t give its audience enough small steps to begin reducing their carbon footprint. If this is the beginning of an energy revolution as the film suggests, certainly we must start somewhere, and the film makes little effort to give people paths with which to lead less polluting lives. The thing that struck me the greatest though was the complete disregard of nuclear energy. <em>Before the Flood</em> was only concerned with converting directly from fossil fuels to renewable sources and electricity. Nuclear power has long been a stepping stone away from fossil fuels, and has not been used to its full extent around the world yet. Nuclear power is relatively clean, except for mining the resources and the radioactive waste it produces, because it has almost 400 times less of a carbon footprint then producing coal energy does. It is negligent of the producers to completely ignore such a valuable and clean form of energy for this film. On a side note, the b-roll footage frequently included evaporation towers as an example of pollution, which emit nothing but water vapor, and troubled animals and wildlife with no explanation of their condition with respect to climate change. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One aspect of the film which I did appreciate was its depiction of large corporations in a largely negative light. The Big Business aspect of climate change is certainly a barrier to change in the energy world, and <em>Before the Flood</em> does a respectable job at conveying it. However, the shortcomings of this film keep me from viewing it positively, as I was already aware of all the ideas it presented, and found many of them questionable. The information in it can be used in our STEM projects to understand the environmental impact of technological progress on the environment, and is something more than just to consider, but to act upon. The film also highlights a major problem with many of the world’s democratic societies, which is the inability to facilitate change quickly, especially in dire times.

			<h3 class="ui header">STEM Mentoring</h3>
			<h4 class="ui header">1/23/17</h4>
  				<p>
  					The STEM Mentoring project provided the kids with a unique experience and entry into the STEM world and its possibilities, as well as gave us valuable experience as leaders and instructors. However, there are several shortcomings about the program that can be solved in the future.
  				</p>
				<p>
					The concept of sharing such a prominent subject to the smart minds of future generations will ultimately teach problem solving, and enhance their logical thinking skills as they work to find solutions to problems through programming and robotics. All of my complaints stem from the lack of management from the administration that ultimately organized our meetings, and provided the infrastructure with which to teach. The software that we used to program the robots had issues which even us 4th year computer science students could not solve, rendering many teams inept and frustrated for extended periods of time. It would have also been extremely helpful to have a static curriculum for the mentors to follow, to ensure that all the groups got the same information and type instruction; mentors were frequently “winging“ their instruction with little to no guide. I felt that many groups got unequal instruction and even realized how disorganized some of the scheduling was. Next year, I hope to organize a course of instruction for all mentors to follow, and test all of the software and robots to ensure that they do indeed function as intended so as to not disrupt the steady instruction.
