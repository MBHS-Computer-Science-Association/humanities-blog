  				The alpha students at Webb, while facing various levels of success, they all seemed to have an overall enjoyable experience, and while the extent of ‘book knowledge’ they learned will only be known to me with time, an immediate and noticeable growth of teamwork and general group collaboration skills was not only apparent, but, in certain groups, shined through their rough experiences of schedule delays, missing parts, and general stress. This growth alone, I believe, constitutes a reason to continue the program. In matter a fact, the plethora of problems were not deep-rooted and would, hopefully, be resolved with more preparation, training, and the experience of having done it once before. The base idea of the program fascinates me, and I feel that stimulus to introduce young, motivated, students to STEM in a fun way opens a plethora of opportunities for future exploration and growth; this base idea must be conserved to continue offering STEM opportunities to the future, ‘broadening their horizons’, and making them more prepared to choose electives in middle and high school which appeal to their own interests, which would be significantly better informed and inspired through this experience.</p>
<p>In my experience as a mentor, I felt the largest issue was a perpetual, and poorly disguised, organizational incompetence. To continue this program, therefore, the alpha program MUST take a far more prepared approach, including, but not limited to: checking equipment beforehand, a formalized and strict calendar, pre-distribution of volunteers, closer monitoring of the students (particularly in regards to all group members working within their own roles, to combat the poorly conceived notions held by students that roles were largely irrelevant, and they should work where they felt the most help was needed-which resulted in a product grossly unbalanced in its completion), and, perhaps most importantly, a more formalized system to transfer information regarding scheduling changes to ALL members of the program, including the teachers, the volunteers, the Boyd teachers, the alpha coordinators, and all other interested parties.
