  			<p>
  				The alpha students at Webb, while facing various levels of success, they all seemed to have an overall enjoyable experience, and while the extent of ‘book knowledge’ they learned will only be known to me with time, an immediate and noticeable growth of teamwork and general group collaboration skills was not only apparent, but, in certain groups, shined through their rough experiences of schedule delays, missing parts, and general stress. This growth alone, I believe, constitutes a reason to continue the program. In matter a fact, the plethora of problems were not deep-rooted and would, hopefully, be resolved with more preparation, training, and the experience of having done it once before. The base idea of the program fascinates me, and I feel that stimulus to introduce young, motivated, students to STEM in a fun way opens a plethora of opportunities for future exploration and growth; this base idea must be conserved to continue offering STEM opportunities to the future, ‘broadening their horizons’, and making them more prepared to choose electives in middle and high school which appeal to their own interests, which would be significantly better informed and inspired through this experience.</p>
<p>In my experience as a mentor, I felt the largest issue was a perpetual, and poorly disguised, organizational incompetence. To continue this program, therefore, the alpha program MUST take a far more prepared approach, including, but not limited to: checking equipment beforehand, a formalized and strict calendar, pre-distribution of volunteers, closer monitoring of the students (particularly in regards to all group members working within their own roles, to combat the poorly conceived notions held by students that roles were largely irrelevant, and they should work where they felt the most help was needed-which resulted in a product grossly unbalanced in its completion), and, perhaps most importantly, a more formalized system to transfer information regarding scheduling changes to ALL members of the program, including the teachers, the volunteers, the Boyd teachers, the alpha coordinators, and all other interested parties.

  			<h1 class="ui header">Before the Flood</h1>
  			<p>Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental awareness documentary approaches climate change with an interesting start: displaying Bosh’s The Garden of Earthly Delights, an early Northern Renaissance painting depicting a transition from one panel to the next, Garden of Eden, growing debauchery, and a final hellish panel. Before truly asserting his position, DiCaprio offers a concession, he admits his own lack of knowledge in the field of ecology and much science in general, but then begins to support his validity by beginning his story of travels across the world to examine the impacts of climate change. The tone of the documentary is interesting, as it shifts between a more logical tone with scientists who present evidence showing not only the fact of climate change, but also evidence on shifting currents, ice cap damage, and ecological consequences of humans stretching beyond climate change, such as ocean ecosystem destruction. It also presents certain ways in which individuals can help the environment, namely lowered meat, especially beef, consumption. The last tone is starkly different as it presents upcoming issues in a way that almost feels like fearmongering they give broad scientific estimates and then expound upon them to assert the necessity of immediate and large-scale action.
  			</p>
			<p>I feel that I have a well-informed perspective on the presented issues, as I have studied ecology in AP Biology, the impacts of industrialization and urbanization impacts in Human Geography, and the chemistry of pollution in AP Chemistry. Combined, this knowledge allowed me to view the information without hearing it for the first time, while my teacher’s bias factors in as well, much of the information falling under the logical arguments was accurate and was largely free of malice. Despite this, I was quite annoyed with other points, the fearmongering felt disconcerting as it was horrendously biased and garnered support in the wrong ways. Secondly, many arguments made strayed from DiCaprio’s intent, and ran, at best, tangential to it, for example, he lingered on the effect of big oil lobbying in the US government this feels more like a critique of our politics, rather than arguing for action to reverse climate change. If anything, this seems to demoralize the viewer into feeling that their efforts may ultimately be useless. Due to the focus I am planning for my project, I most likely will be unable to use the documentary in my final product.

			<h1 class ="ui header">What Makes You Click</h1>
			<p>
				What Makes You Click is a critique of modern advertising mediums and company’s attempts to get more clicks and time online. The evidence is mainly taken from behavioral scientists which explains methods utilized by tech giants, such as A/B testing (showing different versions of a website to users to test the influence of relatively small changes), to grab your attention. The director also explains the current trends in society towards connecting and keeping people connected, and how many people have been habituated to check their phones whenever they are bored, so that it can provide a stimulus for their life. This is where the documentary moves into a scarier realm: can tech giants learn to manipulate you into a puppet, the competition for your time and money stops being a competition. One psychologists says that not only is it a possibility, but rather an eventuality, making a disturbing comparison of youth on their phones to slot machine players, who keep spinning not because of some goal of winning, but because of their addiction to a ‘random intermittent rewards’, the chance that they will win something at some point. Saying this is exactly like someone checking their phone, they may ‘win’ a text message or email they can read and/or respond to, but may ‘lose’ with nothing of value. The documentary ends with a call for government intervention to create a set of ethics for companies to avoid consumer manipulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that the message is well conveyed and even does represent the company side, by showing their viewpoint, of wanting to make the user experience more connected. The director even concedes that services such as facebook and youtube are amazing for being connected to your friends, family, and content about nearly everything, but state that the rampant addictions to modern technology may pose a challenge to the future. I personally believe that the message was well delivered and did not feel overtly biased, which facilitated a more powerful argument, especially since the solution seems logical: implement some general ethics and make the companies strive to create a user experience which facilitates the user’s desires, rather than shaping them. I think that it is an interesting piece to incorporate into a STEM based project as it can show implications of the field along with technology’s power over our lives.

			<h1 class ="ui header">Blade Runner</h1>
			<p>
				Blade Runner, as a Sci-fi film, is very STEM heavy and incorporates a lot of technology in the main plot, which revolves around the ‘retiring’ of androids. Concerns regarding technology forms the backbone of the film as it dwells in moral and ethical issues regarding the androids in future; in the film, androids are utilized for hard labor and given a short life time so they refrain from developing human emotions or the desire for a higher standing in life. The corporation actively indulges in memory manipulation and cruel tactics to control the androids. The main character must confront the question of, ‘what is it to be human?’ as he is forced to subdue androids seeking the chance to extend their lives. This is especially pertinent in the android, Roy’s, final monologue, where he expresses his experiences, being lost, like his tears in the rain, it shows his sincere desire for his existence to matter. This existential crisis for an android on death’s door is starkly opposed to the near inhumanity of Tyrell Corporation, which attempts to scientifically manage the androids. It also serves to make the androids appear not only visually indistinguishable, but perhaps totally indistinguishable from humanity.
			</p>
			<p>
					I believe that many, myself included, felt an interesting perspective on androids afterwards, as, unlike many films, they were not viewed as inherently evil, or villains against a struggling humanity, but rather as those humans themselves. It also allows you to look into Harrison Ford’s deeply disturbed character (an alcoholic, loner, and societal deviant), which has been torn by his demanding job of essentially murder, as he is forced to return to his work for a final time by a oppressive police force and corporate interests. While Roy’s impulsiveness and murderous intent is morally reprehensible, it feels genuine and human in the confused and dark society of Blade Runner, maximized through clever lighting effects, the sound manipulation from blimps and the streets, along with the general weather effects. It is hard to form an educated opinion on the presentation, as artificial intelligence/life does not exist in any capacity even vaguely resembling the complexity of that in the film, but the questions presented are still essential: what is humanity; and even broader, with the amount of synthetic life, including snakes, pets, toys, and more, the question of what is real? The darker theme and setting also worked to present a less optimistic look on future society, rife with poverty and crime, as many flee to off-world colonies, they leave a society filled with many minority populations which is displayed grandly with some large corporations and grand power stations, but whenever the streets are shown, one sees dirty streets, cramped market stalls, overcrowding, and the main character goes to a club, showing moral debauchery, and a strong drinking culture of the society. This view is certainly not appealing and works to amplify the societal issues in the film, centered around a seeming dehumanization in society as certain technical elements take over.
