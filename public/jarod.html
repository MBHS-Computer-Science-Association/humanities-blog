  				The alpha students at Webb, while facing various levels of success, they all seemed to have an overall enjoyable experience, and while the extent of ‘book knowledge’ they learned will only be known to me with time, an immediate and noticeable growth of teamwork and general group collaboration skills was not only apparent, but, in certain groups, shined through their rough experiences of schedule delays, missing parts, and general stress. This growth alone, I believe, constitutes a reason to continue the program. In matter a fact, the plethora of problems were not deep-rooted and would, hopefully, be resolved with more preparation, training, and the experience of having done it once before. The base idea of the program fascinates me, and I feel that stimulus to introduce young, motivated, students to STEM in a fun way opens a plethora of opportunities for future exploration and growth; this base idea must be conserved to continue offering STEM opportunities to the future, ‘broadening their horizons’, and making them more prepared to choose electives in middle and high school which appeal to their own interests, which would be significantly better informed and inspired through this experience.</p>
<p>In my experience as a mentor, I felt the largest issue was a perpetual, and poorly disguised, organizational incompetence. To continue this program, therefore, the alpha program MUST take a far more prepared approach, including, but not limited to: checking equipment beforehand, a formalized and strict calendar, pre-distribution of volunteers, closer monitoring of the students (particularly in regards to all group members working within their own roles, to combat the poorly conceived notions held by students that roles were largely irrelevant, and they should work where they felt the most help was needed-which resulted in a product grossly unbalanced in its completion), and, perhaps most importantly, a more formalized system to transfer information regarding scheduling changes to ALL members of the program, including the teachers, the volunteers, the Boyd teachers, the alpha coordinators, and all other interested parties.

  			<p>Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental awareness documentary approaches climate change with an interesting start: displaying Bosh’s The Garden of Earthly Delights, an early Northern Renaissance painting depicting a transition from one panel to the next, Garden of Eden, growing debauchery, and a final hellish panel. Before truly asserting his position, DiCaprio offers a concession, he admits his own lack of knowledge in the field of ecology and much science in general, but then begins to support his validity by beginning his story of travels across the world to examine the impacts of climate change. The tone of the documentary is interesting, as it shifts between a more logical tone with scientists who present evidence showing not only the fact of climate change, but also evidence on shifting currents, ice cap damage, and ecological consequences of humans stretching beyond climate change, such as ocean ecosystem destruction. It also presents certain ways in which individuals can help the environment, namely lowered meat, especially beef, consumption. The last tone is starkly different as it presents upcoming issues in a way that almost feels like fearmongering they give broad scientific estimates and then expound upon them to assert the necessity of immediate and large-scale action.
  			</p>
			<p>I feel that I have a well-informed perspective on the presented issues, as I have studied ecology in AP Biology, the impacts of industrialization and urbanization impacts in Human Geography, and the chemistry of pollution in AP Chemistry. Combined, this knowledge allowed me to view the information without hearing it for the first time, while my teacher’s bias factors in as well, much of the information falling under the logical arguments was accurate and was largely free of malice. Despite this, I was quite annoyed with other points, the fearmongering felt disconcerting as it was horrendously biased and garnered support in the wrong ways. Secondly, many arguments made strayed from DiCaprio’s intent, and ran, at best, tangential to it, for example, he lingered on the effect of big oil lobbying in the US government this feels more like a critique of our politics, rather than arguing for action to reverse climate change. If anything, this seems to demoralize the viewer into feeling that their efforts may ultimately be useless. Due to the focus I am planning for my project, I most likely will be unable to use the documentary in my final product.
